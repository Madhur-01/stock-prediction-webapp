# Real-Time Stock Forecasting Web App
https://stock-prediction-webapp.streamlit.app/

In this project, I developed a web app using Streamlit Cloud to accurately predict stock prices of different companies. The goal was to leverage real-time stock datasets obtained using the yfinance library, which allows easy access to financial data from Yahoo Finance. By utilizing this data, I aimed to provide users with reliable predictions for stocks such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.

The project focused on time series analysis, as stock prices form a time series characterized by an ordered sequence of data points distributed across a specific period. To tackle this problem, I employed various time series techniques, including LSTM, ARIMA, SARIMA, FBProphet, and NeuralProphet. For this particular project, I selected FBProphet due to its lower time complexity and built-in functions for visualizing predictions.

The key technologies utilized in this project include:

1. Python: The primary programming language for developing the app.
2. Numpy and Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
3. Plotly: Employed for data visualization and creating interactive plots.
4. Prophet: Utilized for time series forecasting.
5. Google Colab, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm: Chosen as the Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for development.
6. Python Flask: Employed to set up an HTTP server for handling backend functionalities.
7. Streamlit Cloud: Utilized as the hosting platform for the web app's user interface.
   
This project highlights my proficiency in Python programming, data manipulation and analysis using Numpy and Pandas, data visualization using Plotly, and time series forecasting with FBProphet. It also demonstrates my experience with different IDEs and my ability to deploy web applications on cloud platforms like Streamlit Cloud.
